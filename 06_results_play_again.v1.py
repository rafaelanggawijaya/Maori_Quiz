"""Maori Quiz -game loop- v2
This program is what is responsible for the game mechanics and the question
generating. Easy is straight forward only asking the maori names while hard
chooses between the two asking for english translation of maori words and
vis versa  It also gives a score and times the player
Update: Tried a different list type to do the same thing which is more
suitable for accomplishing the task however has a lot of code"""
